# adonis-on-fire

This project succesfully combines the Adonis.js "hello world" project with a Firebase project for hosting using Firebase Functions & Hosting.

It only serves a single rendered page, and could be cleaned up a bit, but essentially shows that Adonis can be serverlessly hosted on Firebase.
